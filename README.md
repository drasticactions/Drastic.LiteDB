# Drastic.LiteDB

Drastic.LiteDB is a fork of LiteDB, based on [litedb-for-vrc-get](https://github.com/vrc-get/LiteDB-for-vrc-get/tree/litedb-for-vrc-get), itself a fork. So, a fork of a fork.

This fork has the majority of LiteDBs featured turned off (LINQ, Query support), to enable support for NativeAOT. This is similar to [UltraLiteDB](https://github.com/rejemy/UltraLiteDB).

At this time there is zero support for this project. Don't use it in production. If you really feel the need to use it, fork it.
